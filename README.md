# Playdate
A repository for all the tools and resources I made for the Playdate console.

## Fonts ##
The fonts folder contains a collection of fonts in Playdate format that I've created or converted. You can open them in [Playdate Caps](https://play.date/caps/) to preview. There will be a *white* version and a *black* version of each font. Some fonts may also have a *bold* variation. Some fonts that are not yet complete will be marked *wip*. The following is the list of the fonts that are currently available.

- Cider (*basically the Apple II font in Playdate format*)
- Orange (*variation of the Cider with custom characters*)
- Stucky (*if you want tiny little characters this is it*)
- Tango (*created specifically for a game with the same name*)  
- Vortex (*large vector style font good for title/heading*)
